HackMIT-Lockshare-server
========================

Lockshare (Smart Lock) server code

This is the server code my team and I used in our project at HackMIT.
Our app communicates with this server to control your smart lock.

Features:
  You can unlock your door using the fingerprint reader on the iPhone (if there is no fingerprint reader then you may enter a password)
  The door will automatically lock when you leave the location you have set as your house.
  You can give permission to others for limited time to lock/unlock your door.
  
The app works by communicating with a server to lock and unlock your door.

My team and I placed top 16 at HackMIT with this project.
